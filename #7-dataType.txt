js Primitive Data Types vs. Reference Types
    #01:-----> Primitive Data Types.
    01. stored directly in the location the variable accesses.
    02. Stored on the stack.

        # String
        # Number
        # Boolean
        # Null
        # Undefined
        # Symbols (ES6)----.




 #02:-----> Reference Types
    01. Accesses by Reference
    02. Objects that are stored on the heap
    03. A Pointer to a location in memory.

        # Array 
        # Object Literals
        # Functions
        # Dates
        # Anything Else---.


#03:------> Dynamically Typed Language
    #01. Types are associated with values not variables.
    #02. The same variable can hold multiple Types.
    #03. We do not need to specify types.
    #04. Most other language are statically typed(Java, C#, C++).
    #05. There are supersets of JS ans addons to allow static typing(TypeScript, Flow)
